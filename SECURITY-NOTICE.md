# 🚨 SECURITY NOTICE: Repository Sanitized

## **Security Fixes Applied**

This repository has been **sanitized** to remove all sensitive information:

### **✅ What Was Fixed:**
- 🔐 **Stripe API Keys** → Replaced with placeholders
- 🗃️ **Database Credentials** → Replaced with placeholders  
- 🔑 **JWT Secrets** → Replaced with placeholders
- 🛡️ **Encryption Keys** → Replaced with placeholders

### **🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented:**
- All sensitive data moved to `.env` files (not tracked by git)
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` prevents future exposure
- Configuration templates provided for safe setup
- Environment-based configuration system

### **⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPERS:**

1. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`** and add your real values
2. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
3. **Use test keys only** for development
4. **Rotate any exposed keys** immediately

### **📁 Configuration Files:**
- `config/local_config.php` → Now uses placeholder values
- `.env.example` → Template for environment variables
- `.gitignore` → Comprehensive security exclusions

The repository is now **safe for public sharing** and follows security best practices.

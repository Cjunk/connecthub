# ConnectHub Event Management System - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Successfully Implemented Event Management System

### What We've Built

The **Event Management System** is now fully functional and integrated with the existing Group Management System. Here's what organizers like John can now do:

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. **Event Creation for Group Leaders**
- **Who can create events**: Group Owners, Co-Hosts, and Moderators
- **Form location**: `/public/create-event.php?group_id={group_id}`
- **Access**: "Create Event" button appears in group detail page for authorized users

#### 2. **Comprehensive Event Management**
- **Event Types**: In-Person, Online, Hybrid events
- **Event Details**: Title, description, date/time, location, requirements
- **Pricing**: Free or paid events
- **Attendance**: Maximum attendee limits (optional)
- **Status**: Draft or Published events

#### 3. **RSVP System**
- **User Responses**: Going, Maybe, Can't Go
- **Notes**: Optional notes for special requirements
- **Tracking**: Real-time attendee counts
- **Permissions**: Only members can RSVP

#### 4. **Event Discovery**
- **Events Page**: `/public/events.php` - Browse all upcoming events
- **Search & Filter**: By group, location type, date range
- **Group Integration**: Events displayed on group detail pages

#### 5. **Database Schema**
- **Complete tables**: events, event_attendees, event_categories, event_comments, event_media
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys to groups and users
- **Sample data**: Pre-populated with example events for testing

### 🔗 Key Integration Points

#### Updated Group Detail Page
```php
// Added "Create Event" button for authorized users
<?php if ($userRole === 'owner' || $userRole === 'co_host' || $userRole === 'moderator'): ?>
    <a href="/connecthub/public/create-event.php?group_id=<?= $group['id'] ?>" class="btn btn-primary">
        <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> Create Event
    </a>
<?php endif; ?>
```

#### Enhanced Group Model
```php
// Added event creation permission check
public function canUserCreateEvents($userId, $groupId) {
    $role = $this->getUserRole($groupId, $userId);
    return in_array($role, ['owner', 'co_host', 'moderator']);
}
```

#### Updated Navigation
- **Events Link**: Now points to `/public/events.php` (was under-construction)
- **Groups Link**: Now points to `/public/groups.php` (was under-construction)

### 📋 File Structure

#### New Files Created
```
public/
├── create-event.php        # Event creation form
├── event-detail.php        # Event details and RSVP
└── events.php              # Event listing and search

src/models/
└── Event.php               # Complete event model (already existed, enhanced)

database/
└── create_events_tables.sql # Database schema (complete)
```

#### Enhanced Files
```
src/models/Group.php           # Added canUserCreateEvents() method
public/group-detail.php        # Added Create Event button
src/views/layouts/header.php   # Updated navigation links
```

### 🎯 User Experience Flow

#### For Group Organizers (John's Experience)
1. **Login** to ConnectHub
2. **Navigate** to their group's detail page
3. **See "Create Event" button** (only if Owner/Co-Host/Moderator)
4. **Click Create Event** → Form opens with group pre-selected
5. **Fill event details**: Date, time, location, description, etc.
6. **Choose status**: Draft (edit later) or Published (immediate)
7. **Submit** → Event created and redirected to event detail page

#### For Group Members
1. **View events** on group detail page or events listing
2. **Click event** to see full details
3. **RSVP** with Going/Maybe/Can't Go
4. **Add notes** for special requirements
5. **View attendee list** and event location/online links

### 🚀 What's Working

#### Permissions System
- ✅ Only group leaders can create events
- ✅ Role hierarchy: Owner > Co-Host > Moderator > Member
- ✅ Event creators and group leaders can manage events

#### Event Types
- ✅ **In-Person**: Requires venue name and address
- ✅ **Online**: Requires meeting link (shown to confirmed attendees)
- ✅ **Hybrid**: Requires both venue and online link

#### RSVP Management
- ✅ One RSVP per user per event
- ✅ Real-time attendee counting
- ✅ Optional notes for special requirements
- ✅ RSVP status tracking (going/maybe/not_going)

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Event Model Methods
```php
create($data)              # Create new event
getById($id)               # Get event by ID
getBySlug($slug)           # Get event by URL slug
getByGroup($groupId)       # Get group's events
getUpcoming()              # Get upcoming events
rsvp($eventId, $userId)    # RSVP to event
canUserEditEvent()         # Check edit permissions
```

#### Database Features
- ✅ Referential integrity with groups and users
- ✅ Unique slug generation for SEO-friendly URLs
- ✅ Automatic timestamp tracking
- ✅ Event status workflow (draft → published → cancelled)
- ✅ RSVP conflict prevention (one per user per event)

### 🎯 Ready for Testing

The system is now ready for John and other group organizers to:

1. **Create Events** in their groups
2. **Manage RSVPs** and see who's attending
3. **Edit Events** after creation
4. **View Analytics** of event attendance
